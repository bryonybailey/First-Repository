    <h2>Fallout New Vegas</h2>
    <p>Fallout: New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic role-playing video game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda Softworks. While New Vegas is not a direct sequel, it uses the same engine and style as Fallout 3, and many of its developers worked on previous Fallout games at Black Isle Studios. It is the fourth major installment in the Fallout series and the sixth overall. The game is set primarily in a post-apocalyptic Nevada, California, Arizona and Utah.
<br>
<br>
    The game was released on October 19, 2010, in North America, October 22, 2010, in Europe, and November 4, 2010, in Asia. It is available on the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. A backwards compatible version for Xbox One was released on June 23, 2016.</p>

    <h2>StoryLine</h2>
    <p>The game is set in and around a post-apocalyptic retro-futuristic Las Vegas, following the Great War between the U.S. and China, as a conventional and nuclear war that occurred on October 23, 2077. It lasted less than two hours and caused immense damage and destruction. Before the Great War, the Resource Wars took place, during which business magnate and CEO of RobCo Industries Robert House used his vast wealth to make preparations to protect the city. Due to his efforts, out of the 77 atomic warheads that targeted Las Vegas and its surrounding areas, the networked mainframes were able to predict and force-transmit disarm code subsets to 59 of them, neutralizing them before impact. Nine more were destroyed by laser cannons, allowing only a few to make contact outside of the city limits.
<br>
<br>
<br>
    Fallout: New Vegas takes place in 2281, four years after the events of Fallout 3, 40 years after Fallout 2, 120 years after Fallout, and six years before the events of Fallout 4. The New California Republic plays a major part in the game's story, being in a three-way struggle among both Mr. House and slave army of Caesar's Legion.

        The Courier, the player character, was meant to deliver a package from Primm to New Vegas but they were intercepted by the Great Khans led by Benny, who shoots them and takes the package, leaving the Courier for dead in a shallow grave. They are rescued by a robot named Victor, and is taken to the town of Goodsprings, where Doc Mitchell saves their life. After the Courier is given some medical tests, they enter the open world, and the quest Ain't That a Kick in the Head begins.
        
        Fallout: New Vegas has a definitive ending, unlike Fallout 3. The endings for Fallout: New Vegas are dependent on what actions are taken during the game's events, with separate endings shown for each major location, political faction, and recruited companion.</p>
