    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Fallout is a series of post-apocalyptic role-playing games produced and published by Bethesda Softworks,
        originally created by Interplay Entertainment. Although set in and after the 22nd century, its story and artwork
        are heavily influenced by the post-World War II nuclear paranoia of the 1950s. The series is lightly based on
        the Mad Max film series, and is sometimes considered to be a spiritual successor to Wasteland.</p>
    
    <h2>StoryLine</h2>
    <p>The background story of Fallout involves a "what-if" scenario in which the United States of America tries to
        devise fusion power resulting in the whole country becoming hegemonic and having less reliance on petroleum.
        However, this is not achieved until 2077, shortly after an oil drilling conflict off the Pacific Coast pits the
        United States against China. It ends with a nuclear exchange resulting in the post-apocalyptic world in which
        the game takes place.
        <br>
        <br>
        Before the nuclear exchange took place, great underground Vaults were constructed across America, supposedly to
        protect the populace from the dangers of radiation. Although only 122 were constructed, over 400,000 would be
        needed to protect the entire nation. This is because the Vaults were not intended to save humanity; rather, they
        were social experiments being conducted by the United States government. Most vaults featured some variables to
        test how certain things influence people or how they would react.

    <p>Licensed by Glutton Creeper Games by Interplay, this project would have brought Fallout to the tabletop through the D20 gaming system made popular by Dungeons and Dragons. Although Bethesda brought legal action against the project, it was eventually released as Exodus, with the Fallout elements removed.</p>
